# Design Patterns

## ðŸ’¡ What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They provide a standard way to organize code and are based on **best practices** refined over time by experienced developers.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Design patterns help **improve code readability**, **reusability**, and **maintainability**.
- They are **language-independent**, but commonly applied in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Patterns are **not code templates**, but rather general **conceptual solutions** that can be adapted to specific problems.
- Categorized into three main types:
  - **Creational** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder)
  - **Structural** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite)
  - **Behavioral** (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)
- Following design patterns leads to **more flexible and scalable architecture**.

# 1. Creational Design Patterns
## 1.a ðŸ§© Singleton Design Pattern

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.
