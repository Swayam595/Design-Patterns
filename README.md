# [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

## ðŸ’¡ What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They provide a standard way to organize code and are based on **best practices** refined over time by experienced developers.

### âœ… Key Points:
- Design patterns help **improve code readability**, **reusability**, and **maintainability**.
- They are **language-independent**, but commonly applied in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Patterns are **not code templates**, but rather general **conceptual solutions** that can be adapted to specific problems.
- Categorized into three main types:
  - **Creational** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype)
  - **Structural** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite)
  - **Behavioral** (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)
- Following design patterns leads to **more flexible and scalable architecture**.

## 1. [Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/Swayam595/Design-Patterns/tree/main/creational)
- Focuses on solving common problems related to object creation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process making it more flexible and reusable.
- Commonly occurring problems with respect to creation of object of an entity
### 1.a ðŸ§© [Singleton Design Pattern](https://github.com/Swayam595/Design-Patterns/tree/main/creational/singleton)

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### 1.b ðŸ§± [Builder Design Pattern](https://github.com/Swayam595/Design-Patterns/tree/main/creational/builder)









## 2. Structural Design Patterns
- Concerned with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns help define clear relationships and structure between entities to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
- Addresses how should different classes relate to each other, what attributes/ methods should be in a class, how codebase should be structured.

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
- Deals with object interaction and communication. These patterns define how responsibilities are distributed and how objects cooperate to perform tasks.
